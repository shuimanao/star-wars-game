# Star Wars Game

Welcome to my very basic (for now) Star Wars Game! I built it with React, Typescript and [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/documentation).

## **Scripts which you can use:**

```bash

npm run build

```

Compiles your package with TypeScript Compiler to JavaScript (ES6).

---

```bash

npm start

```

Compiles your package and starts development server that provides live reloading (thanks to webpack-dev-server).

---

```bash

npm run test

```

Runs unit tests for the project. Output with coverage report will be available in the console.

## **My TO DO list:**

I consider this as basic version of the app and I have few things in mind to improve it:

- Make a reusable component, which can replace PlayPeople and PlayStarships components.
- Add ErrorBoundary.
- Consider adding some context instead of internal state in components.
- Maybe ReactQuery for fetching the data and handling cache?
- Improve unit tests
- ...
